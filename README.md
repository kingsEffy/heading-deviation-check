This is a small Matlab based project that pulls a public CRCNS stc-1 (MSTd) file, extracts the visual optic-flow heading responses, folds them onto your four radial headings (45, 135, 225, 315), and runs your linearfit_radical unchanged. It also prints quadrant counts and population heading so you can confirm forward/backward with deviations on a real, peer-reviewed dataset.
